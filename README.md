## Portals and Portals - Final project for the Programming concept 1 class

### Description
Our project, "Portals and Portals", is a spin-off of the classic game of Snakes and Ladders. In our version, we have replaced the traditional snakes and ladders with portals, adding a new level of excitement and strategy to the game. Players must navigate through the board, collecting cards along the way to make important decisions and play an active role in the game. The goal is to reach the end of the board and the exit. This project is the final project for our Programming concepts 1 class, where we learned the basics of the Python language and used it to create this unique and engaging game. We used Python 3.10 as the programming language and Visual Studio Code as the development environment. The game's visuals are represented in the terminal. Overall, this project is a great showcase of our programming skills and demonstrates our ability to bring creative ideas to life.

### Installation
In order to properly experience the game, "Portals and portals", it is recommended to have Python version 3.10 and Visual Studio Code installed. Additionally, for optimal visual representation, it is suggested to install the termcolor library. This can be done by utilizing the command line within Visual Studio Code's terminal and entering the command: "pip3 install termcolor".
